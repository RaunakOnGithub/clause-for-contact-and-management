## 🚀 About the Project
**Clause** is a clean, modern landing page concept designed to showcase a SaaS tool for managing contracts and teams.  
The focus is on **simplicity**, **readability**, and **trust-building UI**—qualities that make any landing page high-converting.  

This project was built with **Tailwind CSS** and best practices in responsive web design.  
It’s not just a landing page—it’s a study in how **color theory** and **UI clarity** can make or break first impressions.

## 🎨 Color Theory in Action
We carefully applied color psychology to reinforce the brand’s message:  

- **🌿 Dark Green (#073127)** → Trust, stability, and professionalism.  
- **🍋 Lime Green (#E2FB8C)** → Energy, innovation, and growth.  
- **⚪ Soft White (#FAFAFA)** → Clean backgrounds for maximum readability.  

By pairing a **calming dark base** with a **bright accent lime**, the design creates contrast and focus—guiding the user’s eyes naturally toward CTAs like **“Start for Free”** and **“Get a Demo.”**
